# datascienceproj
Project where we estimate data science professional salary
Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
Data cleaning is done to filter out any unwanted or irregular data to make the dataset error free to run and smoothly do Analysis.
Data exploratory analysis 
1. Identifying the problem and project planning
2. Data collection using a kaggle dataset
3. data cleaning using libraries in python- pandas
4. Exploratory data analysis using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
5. Build a model 
   5.1 multiple linear regression
   5.2 #lasso regression
   5.3 random forest
   5.4 tune model GridsearchCV
   5.5 test ensembles


6. Created an Flask API locally, where a request could be made and the model returns the best estimated value.
